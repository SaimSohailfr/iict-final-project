                <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <br> <br>
<p>
Fit League was born in 2007 with a simple vision: to create a space where sports lovers of all ages could train, compete, and belong. What began as a small group of passionate coaches and athletes has grown into one of the most diverse and dynamic sports clubs in the region.
</p> 
               <br>
                <br>
<p>
We started with just a tennis court and a handful of members—but our dedication, community spirit, and focus on quality quickly set us apart. Over the years, we expanded to include swimming, squash, golf, hockey, and more. Today, we are proud to host hundreds of members and offer expert-led training programs designed to develop skill, discipline, and love for the game.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    From kids taking their first swing to adults chasing peak performance, Fit League is more than a club—it's a community, a movement, and a league of its own.
